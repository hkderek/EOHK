I've designed a comprehensive **4-tier membership system** for EOHK based on the membership structure document. Here's what I've built:

## üèÜ **4-Tier Membership Structure**

### **Tier Progression Based on EO Fiscal Years:**

- **Member** (0-10 years): Full dues, full benefits
- **Master** (11-15 years): 1/3 off local dues, full benefits
- **Hero** (16-20 years): 2/3 off local dues, limited benefits
- **Legend** (21+ years): Free local dues, user-pay benefits


## ‚úÖ **Key Database Features:**

### **1. Automatic Tier Calculation**

- **Smart tier assignment** based on EO fiscal years
- **Automatic updates** when member years change
- **Opt-down capability** for Hero/Legend members


### **2. Comprehensive Dues Management**

```sql
-- Example: Master member with 13 EO years
Local Dues: $50,000 √ó (100% - 33%) = $33,400
Global Dues: $30,000 (always 100%)
Total: $63,400
```

### **3. Benefits Tracking System**

- **Benefit categories**: Annual dinner, Christmas party, learning events, etc.
- **Usage limits**: Hero members get 5 learning events, 5 spousal benefits
- **User-pay tracking** for Legend tier benefits


### **4. Fiscal Year Management**

- **Year-by-year tracking** of member tier and dues
- **Renewal deadlines** (June 14th each year)
- **Payment status** monitoring
- **Historical records** of tier progression


## üéØ **Perfect for EOHK's Goals:**

### **"EO FOR LIFE" Implementation**

- **Tenure appreciation** with increasing discounts
- **Flexible benefits** that adapt to member lifecycle
- **30th Anniversary preparation** (1996-2026)


### **Revenue Optimization**

- **Predictable dues structure** with clear discount tiers
- **Retention incentives** for long-term members
- **Fair progression** rewarding loyalty


### **Administrative Efficiency**

- **Automated tier calculations**
- **Bulk renewal processing**
- **Comprehensive reporting** and analytics


## üìä **Dashboard Features:**

### **Membership Analytics:**

- **Tier distribution** across all members
- **Revenue projections** by tier
- **Tenure member tracking** (Hero + Legend)
- **30th Anniversary countdown**


### **Benefits Management:**

- **Usage tracking** for limited benefits
- **User-pay event management**
- **Spousal and children benefits** monitoring


The system seamlessly handles the transition from the old Alumni programs (discontinued June 30, 2024) to the new 4-tier structure, ensuring EOHK can effectively manage their "EO FOR LIFE" vision!
